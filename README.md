# CodeIgniter HTMX adapted for PHP 7

This fork is meant to adapt the library for PHP 7 (the original library only works with PHP 8.x)

NO ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN ADDED YET. What follows comes from the original project.

A set of methods for `IncomingRequest`, `Response` and `RedirectResponse` classes to help you work with [htmx](https://htmx.org) fluently in CodeIgniter 4 framework.

It also provides some additional help with **handling errors** in development mode as well as support for **view fragments**.
