# CodeIgniter HTMX adapted for PHP 7

This fork is meant to adapt the library for PHP 7 (the original library only works with PHP 8.x)

To install the modified library please follow the manual installation instructions of the original package. The demo app should work out of the box.

A set of methods for `IncomingRequest`, `Response` and `RedirectResponse` classes to help you work with [htmx](https://htmx.org) fluently in CodeIgniter 4 framework.

It also provides some additional help with **handling errors** in development mode as well as support for **view fragments**.
